Things to do to improve VIDE:

    (Feb 2, 2000)

* Keep file names currently open. Should re-open in
   same size, position, but that is harder. Easiest way
   to do this is to allow up to 8 or 12 files and save
   them in the vide.ini file.

* Recent files. Save up to 16 in list, save in .ini file.

* grep: This shouldn't be too hard, really. Just spawn
   grep, send results to the status window, and support
   right click to go to that file.

* emacs emulation

* preserve bps across sessions?

  perhaps show current state on status bar...
