VIDE is a full featured IDE for the GNU compiler collection (gcc)
and Sun's Java (JDK 1.2). It has the features you'd expect in an
IDE, including full integrated compiler and debugger support.
Editor command interfaces supported include a standard Windows-like
command set, the longtime Unix favorite Vi, and VIDE's own modal
command set called See. All are real, full-featured programming
editors suitable for the most experienced programmer. Yet VIDE is
very easy to learn and use, and is perfect for a student learning
environment for C++ or Java. VIDE also includes extensive help
support, including one of the most complete compilations of free help
information avaialble on the web. Full source code is available under 
the GPL! A Linux version is available as well.
