              The V Integrated Development Environment
                       February 25, 2000

This is to announce support for the Borland C++ Compiler 5.5
by VIDE Version 1.07. VIDE can build Console, GUI, and static
library project files. It also includes some extra documentation
about the Borland environment. VIDE does not add a debugger,
however.

VIDE is the V Integrated Development Environment for the
Gnu Compiler Collection (gcc), the free Borland C++ Compiler 5.5
for MS-Windows, and the standard Sun Java Development Kit. VIDE
is available both as a ready to run package for MS-Windows 9x/NT
and Linux, and as part of the V C++ GUI Framework. Executables
are available for download at

VIDE has been designed by a programmer for programmers. It makes
the task of developing software for C/C++, Java, and HTML much
easier than using command line mode. It is easy to learn, so it
is a good tool for the beginner. It also has the critical
features needed to enhance the productivity of the experienced
programmer.

While VIDE doesn't have every feature found in many commercial
development systems, it is an ongoing project, with more features
included in each release. And best of all, VIDE is FREE! And
since it is GPLed, you can add even more features if you want.

The main features in the current release of VIDE include:

* A great editor - The VIDE editor is a very good editor designed
    for the programmer. Editor features include:
* Syntax Highlighting for C/C++, Java, Perl, Fortran, TeX and HTML.
* Several menu-selectable editor command sets, including:
   . A generic modeless command set, similar to many Windows editors.
   . Vi - the standard Unix editor, with extensions.
   . The See editor command set, an editor designed and used by
       Bruce Wampler, the author of V and VIDE.
* Beautifies C/C++ and Java code
* Powerful command macro capability
* Complete support for ctags (symbol lookup)
* Project Files - specify source files, compiler options,
     and other details required for C/C++ or Java.
     Project files simplify and hide most of the details of using 
     the underlying tools.
* C/C++ Support - Supports C/C++ development on Windows and Linux with
     the GNU gcc. Supports C/C++ development on Windows with the
     Borland C++ Compiler 5.5.
* Java Support - Supports Java development using the Sun JDK.
* Syntax errors - Point and click to go to errors in source files.
* Supports gdb and jdb - Integrated support for the GNU gdb debugger 
     for C/C++ and Sun's jdb debugger for Java. There is NO support
     for debugging with the Borland BCC32.
* V GUI - Integrated support for the V GUI Framework for C++.
* HTML - Extra support for HTML development.
* Extensive HELP
* Execellent Documentation - Complete reference and tutorial documentation.
