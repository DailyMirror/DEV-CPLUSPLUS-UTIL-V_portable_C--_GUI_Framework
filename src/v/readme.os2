This is the XFREE86/OS2-Version of V1.24.

To compile only two changes were needed (look at vOS::GetHostName 
and vOS::vSleep ). I used the Config.mk file of V1.18-XFREE/OS2
(ftp://24.2.168.186/pub/os2/unix/xfree86/ports/development/v118-src.zip).  

OpenGL isn't implemented and VIDE doesn't compile yet. 

To rebuild go into the srcx directory and run make (the central makefile
doesn't work).
