<h2>Using V from C</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
V GUI looks quite interesting. I wonder if there is a way to
use it from a C program?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
V can be used from C, but you still need to use the basic C++
object oriented framework. Converting an existing C program can
often be difficult because they are often command driven rather
than event driven.
<p>

<dd>
It is much easier to convert a C program that has its major
functionality isolated into routines that get called from the
command interface interpreter. The easiest path is to toss the
interface code and start with a V sample program. Define the
menus and toolbars you need, and then call the appropriate C code
from a 'case' in the 'WindowCommand' routine of the command
window. Given the simple definitions of menus and toolbars, using
this approach requires more cut and paste into the sample code
than complete understanding of C++.
<p>

<dd>
Handling output from the C program may also be a bit difficult.
The V vTextCanvas class may be the easiest. Essentially, it works
just like a classic dumb terminal, like a DOS session from
Windows, or a tty window from X. It isn't a VT100 (say, that
sounds like an interesting project), but it has similar
functionality. Using it will still require minimal understanding
of C++.
<p>

<dd>
In the end, however, learning C++ is really worth it. I've found
the main payback is much more maintainable and robust code. It is
far easier to modify a well-defined object than a piece of even a
good C module, and the modifications don't break the rest of the
system.

<h2>How can I learn C++?</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
I was wondering if you could help me out. I have been trying to
learn C++, and I would like to learn how to use V also. What
can you do to help me?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
Occasionally I get general help requests like this. As much
as I would like to be able to help you out, I really don't
have the time to devote to getting people up to speed on
C++ or GUIs in general.
<p>

<dd>
I do have some strong opinions about C++ and object orientation.
I think OO is wonderful, and that C++ is a reasonable
OO language, if not perfect. It has the overwhelming
advantage of being the marketplace winner. One of the
main problems with C++ that I have found is that there
are no really outstanding C++ books available, either for
the new programmer, or for someone converting to C++.
<p>

<dd>
The main problem I've found is that to use C++ in a reasonable
and effective fashion, you need to use its object-oriented
capabilities. Without really understanding objects, encapsulation,
inheritance, AND aggregation, it is hard to know what
constructors are really good for, why destructors are so
wonderful for managing dynamic objects, and the real significance
of shallow and deep object semantics.
<p>

<dd>
So, given that, I can recommend the following books:
<p>

<dd>
FIRST, get the object-orientation! While these books aren't
perfect, they are the ones I like best:
<p>

<dd>Object-Oriented Systems Design - An Integrated Approach,
<dd>Edward Yourdon, Yourdon Press, ISBN 0-13-636325-3.
<p>

<dd>Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Second Edition, Grady Booch,
<dd>Benjamin/Cummings, ISBN 0-8053-5340-2.
<p>

<dd>The C++ Books are harder to pin down. I really don't like
<dd>any of them. But I probably most use:
<p>

<dd>C++ Primer, 2nd Edition, Stanly B. Lippman, Addison Wesley,
<dd>ISBN 0-201-54848-8.
<p>

<dd>Stroustrup's book is essential after you are proficient
<dd>with C++.
<p>

<dd>
It turns out that GUIs are one of the most natural object-oriented
applications around, so they really do provide a great way
to get started on OO. The use of inheritance, messages, and
real objects makes then seem natural. I think V is a good
example OO GUI. In fact, V started out as a small demo
program for an OO/C++ book I'm trying to write. The V
demo has taken over, and my book is on the back burner...
