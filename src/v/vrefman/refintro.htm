This file is a place holder for the V Reference Manual. It
doesn't make sense to make you download it twice  - once for
VIDE, and once for V. If you don't use V, then you don't need
download it.
<p>
If you do use V, then download it an unzip it to this directory -
usually <tt>C:\Vide\help\vrefman</tt>. Let this 
file, <tt>vrefman.htm</tt>, be replaced.
