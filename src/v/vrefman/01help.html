How can I contribute to the V project?
<p>

<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
As you may know from other sources, so far V has been
pretty much a one person project - me. That means while
V is getting pretty complete, there are still things
missing, and things that could be done to make it better.
<p>

<dd>
I really appreciate help from the ever growing V community.
There are several ways you can help contribute to V:
<p>

1) Find bugs.
<p>

<dd>
If you discover a V bug, I really do appreciate bug reports.
Better are bug reports with a solution. I've received an amazing
number of bug reports along with a patch to the source code to
fix it. While it would be ideal to get a report and a fix, I
still want to get the reports.
<p>

2) Contribute applications.
<p>

<dd>
I'd like to collect two kinds of V applications. First would
be apps that would be useful to the whole V community, either
as a tool, or perhaps as an example of something useful.
I'd also like any kind of app that uses V that you might
wish to share. Any time you can share code that others
might learn from, it will be useful.
<p>

3) Additions to V
<p>

<dd>
V does have some things missing (a direct
draw canvas, multi-selection lists, double click in Athena,
etc.). I would like to see all of these added to V eventually,
but just don't have the time to get to them quickly. I'd
really like contributions such as these.
<p>

<dd>
However, for the contributions to be really useful, they
need to be developed using certain guidelines. First, if
you see a hole you'd like to fill, e-mail me
<a href="mailto:bruce@objectcentral.com">bruce@objectcentral.com</a>
first. Someone else might be working on it, or I might
already have some specific ideas. If it is a big project
(like the OS/2 port), I probably can put you in touch
with others working on the problem.
<p>

<dd>
Second, a new feature for one platform isn't really useful
for inclusion in V. Anything new must run on both Windows
X, and OS/2. There are a few
ways to handle this requirement. First, do the different
versions yourself. Second, find someone else to do the
other platforms. Third, use only existing V classes.
<p>

<dd>
One problem with distributed development by volunteers
is keeping things in sync. I've been turning out a new
version of V every few months, so it is hard to keep
contributions current when they are necessarily done
on older versions. We just have to work with it.
<p>

<p>

<dd>
In summary, I really do like help. It is hard to
coordinate sometimes, but I will do my best. Contributors
will be acknowledged in the appropriate places. Just
send me e-mail with any bugs reports, contributions,
or ideas.
