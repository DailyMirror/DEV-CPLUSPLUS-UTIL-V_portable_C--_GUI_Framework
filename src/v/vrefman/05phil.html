<h2>V in the Computer Science Classroom</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
Is V suitable for CS classes that use C++?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
V has been used in the classroom at the University of New
Mexico, and at several other places. It was used for two UNM CS courses, 
a Senior level software engineering class, and a Junior level
design and programming class.
<p>

<dd>
I used V for my software engineering class, and it was
excellent for that. It let the students get big projects done
with truly neat interfaces. This is the FIRST time I've been able
to teach software engineering and have projects that both use C++
<em>and</em> have a nice user interface. I really didn't want to use
Tcl/Tk for a real software engineering class.
<p>

<dd>V has also been used in the Junior level programming class. It is
when the students first tackle real programs using C++.
The students used V to build some
simple, but real programs that required some design. I didn't
teach the class, but as I recall, one project involved putting
a spinning wheel on the screen, and controlling position and
spin rate using various V controls.  The problems students
had with V involved the standard problems with programming
in general, how to really use classes, constructors, destructors,
etc., and general GUI issues. V itself was really never a
hindrance - just struggling students.
<p>

<dd>
Personally, I really feel V is PERFECT for that level of class.
If you want to use a real programming language (all debates aside,
C++ is real compared to a scripting language), and would like
the students to be able to generate GUI programs, I really don't
know of any alternative to V in an academic environment where
freeware is important.
<p>

<dd>
For the first time, students really were able to fairly easily
generate GUI programs with C++ code. They found this VERY
rewarding and fun. More so that with the old INPUT/OUTPUT
stuff that we were limited to before. And not only that, a
lot of students are getting their own Linux boxes now, and
that makes V even better for them.
<p>

<dd>
I hate to sound like a salesman, but the results I saw at
UNM and have had reported to me at other colleges and universities
make me wish that CS departments all around the country
knew about V, and would consider using it.  There are a couple
of other freeware GUI frameworks (wxWindows and YACL), but neither
is as simple or clean as V. (You can even use V code for case
study, it is very clean.)  I really don't think there is
anything missing from V for student projects. And the manual
is good enough so as to not generate tons of V questions for
the instructor.  (I would get literally ONLY 3 or 4 V questions per
semester from my software engineering class - they really
just asked project questions.)
<p>

<dd>
Well, I've rambled, but I would like to encourage you to take
a serious look at V and consider it for your classes.

<h2>Why does V use static tables for menus?</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
Why have you used static tables of structures to initialize Menu
and Command panes ?
<p>

<dd>
Doesn't object oriented programming include hiding of data structures?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
One can stick strictly to a paradigm, and end up with something
that is obscure and difficult to program with, or one can bend
the rules and end up with something far simpler and easier to use.

<dd>
The ability to easily define menus, dialogs, command bars, and
status bars using structures (which are usually static, but
don't have to be) gives a very simple and easy way to define
these things. After looking at some other OO GUI frameworks,
I decided they were too hard to get started with, and that
you ended up with code that was too hard to maintain. Keeping
all the definitions for V control objects in a single declaration
is much simpler.
<p>

<dd>
The declarations for menus and dialogs actually are replacements
for the resource definitions usually found in the native GUI
toolkits. For example, V does not use standard Windows .RC files
to define menus and dialogs. You will find many similarities
in the elements included in a V dialog CommandObject declaration
and a Windows .RC file.
<p>

<dd>
Underneath it all, however, all the controls are implemented as
C++ objects, and the details of the implementation of each
control object for each platform are hidden. The definitions of
dialogs and menus are platform independent, and easy to define,
modify, and maintain.

<h2>Programming for Windows vs. Unix and X</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
This last is kind of a shot in the dark, but.... I'm trying to do most
of my development on Linux, but also engineer the code for Windows
compatibility.  The portability section in the coding style guidelines
appendix has some good information, but what I was wanting to know
mostly was how the Windows programming environment differs from the
Unix-type environment in terms of memory management, pointer usage,
and the like.  Can you recommend a good book on programming in Windows
to help ease me into this (eventual) port?  If it can explain the
difference between 16-bit and 32-bit Windows (and the differences
between Win32s, Win 95, and Win NT in particular) it would be even
more helpful.  Also, I'm not exactly up on the MDI/SDI thing, either.
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
Windows comes in just two basic flavors, Windows 3.1, which has a
bunch of very ugly properties left over from the segmented
architecture of the Intel 8086, and the 32-bit varieties, which
includes Win32s, Win 95, and Win NT. Win 95 has some nice
dialog controls, but for now V is not using them. Other than
that, all these are really WIN32 platforms.
<p>

<dd>
As a programmer, there is really only one major issue you have
to deal with. The Windows 3.1 platform is basically a 16-bit
platform, and thus limits data objects to a maximum size of
64K bytes. You can have a whole bunch of 64K objects, but
each object can be at most 64K. There are also some limits
(not hard to hit...) on the amount of static data allowed,
again tied to 64K. This one seems to vary from compiler to
compiler, but can be hit by defining a lot of big static
V Icons. I had some problems with the V Icon Editor, for
example.)
<p>

<dd>
The bottom line on Windows 3.1 is that you have to use
what is called Large Model to compile V applications,
and think about the 64K limit for any single data object.
You can't assume that you can compare pointers for
objects allocated separately (but then you shouldn't
assume that anyway), so using pointers in 3.1 really
doesn't create additional problems.
<p>
As of <b>V</b> 1.21, official support for 3.1 has been
abandoned. There have been enough new features added
that have just made keeping V 3.1 compatible too difficult.
<p>

<dd>
The WIN32 platform solves all these problems by using
the linear addressing available on all Intel chips
since the 80386. The WIN32 API to the system is
almost compatible with the older 3.1 API, but there
are some major incompatibilities, and some of that
16-bit ugliness remains. But fortunately, V hides
all of that. For regular old C++ programming, use
'new' and pointers just as you would on a real computer
with a real operating system (like Linux or SunOS!).
<p>

<dd>
I personally don't have much positive to say about
Microsoft (some of it stemming from personal experience
back when I was involved with my own PC software
company), so I've really avoided using Visual C++,
but V users have reported V will compile with it.
I like Borland C++ the best, but Watcom's C++ 10.6
isn't bad, and for one price you get 3.1, 95, NT,
and OS/2 support. If you are associated with an
academic institution, you can get Watcom for only
$100, a really great deal. For NT and 95, the
Cygnus port of gcc is getting pretty reasonable, too,
but it isn't quite native.
<p>

<dd>
I've found the Charles Petzold books the most useful for
getting going, but I also think that Herbert Schildt's
books are pretty good, and would maybe be my first
choice today. There are a lot of BAD Windows books,
and books by either of these two authors are a pretty
safe bet.

<h2>V vs. wxWindows</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
How would you compare V against wxWindows ?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
V and wxWindows are quite similar in their goals. Naturally,
I prefer V. WxWindows has been around a bit longer than V,
and has some tools not available in V.
WxWindows is less fixed in the
look and feel of the apps it generates. WxWindows originally used
Motif and OpenLook implementation for X, and has recently
switched to gtk. V uses
a customized version of the free Athena widgets, and as of 1.21,
also supports gtk.

<p>

<dd>
V, on the other hand, pretty much imposes a look and feel.
It turns out that this look and feel is the standard
Windows look and feel, as well as the Motif look and feel.
Thus, when
using the Xt Athena version, you end up with Windows/Motif
like apps. I think this is a good thing.
<p>

<dd>
You can see a result of this approach in how V builds dialogs.
While wxWindows uses a generic window for both drawing canvases
and dialogs, V uses different objects for each. Thus, on
X, you get a different kind of shell widget used for dialogs
and canvases, while on Windows you get a real Windows dialog
box with its specialized look. Thus your apps will look more native.
<p>

<dd>
The last I looked, V also had more controls for its dialogs.
Adding controls to dialogs and windows is done differently.
In wxWindows, you add each object via a line of code. V lets
you define whole dialogs and menus simply using a static
array. I think this latter approach is much easier to program.
<p>

<dd>
The visual look of V is more polished. This shows especially
in the dialogs. The Windows version has a very nice 3D look
for all dialog components, and the shading and color choices
look much more like polished apps than the standard app colors
generated by wxWindows apps. The X version also uses nice shading,
and allows you to change the color design using an X resource file.
<p>

<dd>
Finally, if you look at the source code, I'm confident you will
find the V code much more readable and well structured. The
wxWindows code seems much less polished, and really lacks comments.
This may be a matter of style - I am a strong believer in
the concept that it is almost impossible to over comment code.
I believe this leads to more maintainable code.

<h2>Using V for commercial applications</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
I've read the GNU License, and I'm not sure if I can use
V for commercial applications. What are the restrictions
for using V for a commercial app?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
The short answer is yes, you can use V for commercial
applications. The following are the relevant sections
of the GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE contained
in the file <tt>COPYING.LIB</tt>:
<p>

<<<<< BEGIN EXCERPT of GNU License >>>>>>
<p>

<dd>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference
between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the
library".  The former contains code derived from the library,
while the latter only works together with the library.
<p>

[stuff deleted]
<p>

<dd>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
License.
<p>

<dd>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a
"work that uses the library".  The executable is therefore
covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
of such executables.
<p>

[stuff deleted]
<p>

<dd>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile
or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
<p>

[NOTE: This language is much more restrictive than it may appear.
The reverse engineering is allowed ONLY for debugging
modifications to the library. There is nothing to imply that
allowing reverse engineering extends to your work, so your
protection remains intact.]
<p>

<dd>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that
the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this
License.  If the work during execution displays copyright
notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy
of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:
<p>

[Several options for supplying access to the library, and object
code for using modified libraries.]
<p>

<<<< END EXCERPT >>>>
<p>

<dd>
My interpretation of all this is that you can pretty much protect
your commercial software. You need to acknowledge that you are
using V, and provide access to V. This can easily be accomplished
by providing a link to the V Web site.
<p>

<dd>
Possibly the most objectionable part requires that you allow
users to relink the work using a modified version of V. This
provision can be satisfied by providing access to the the object
code files only upon request. You are also allowed to charge for
that access. Between these, I don't think there is much real
impact on using V for a commercial package.
<p>

<dd>
So, by my interpretation, you can comply with the GNU license by
doing the following:
<p>

<dd>
1. Acknowledge the use of V, and supply a reference to the
V Web site.
<p>

<dd>
2. Supply a copy of the GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.
The license implies that the object code is available for
relinking for an appropriate charge. I don't think you
need to explicitly state this anywhere else. You can also
make it clear that only the V library uses that GNU
LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, and that your commercial
software uses a different license.
<p>

<dd>
3. Being prepared for the very unlikely event someone will
   actually want to pay for access to the object code to
   relink to a modified version of V.
