<P>
This is the printable version of the V Reference Manual. While the complete
V Documentation is best viewed using a browser for the HTML version, this
printable version is the result of a large number of requests.
<p>
This printable version is a PDF file automatically generated by the
program HTMLDOC (available as freeware under the GPL). Because the
original V HTML version was not designed to convert directly to
a printed book, this printable version may not be optimal. However,
HTMLDOC is an excellent program, and this PDF version should meet
the needs of those wanting a hard copy version.

<HR>
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;is a C++ Graphical User Interface Framework designed
to provide an easy to use and program system for building GUI
applications. The framework is small, elegant, and provides the
tools required for building all but the most specialized
applications.

<p>
The 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;framework has also been designed to be portable.
Currently, versions for the X Windowing System (using a
customized 3D Athena widget set), Microsoft Windows 3.1, and
Microsoft WIN32 (Windows 95 and NT) are available. A version for
OS/2 is also available. A gtk version for X is also under development. The

<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;system is freely available for use by anyone under the terms
of the GNU Library General Public License.

<p>
Why did I write 
<em><b>V</b></em>, and why did I put it under the GNU license? I
have been programming for over 20 years now, and building
interactive applications for most of that time. During that time,
I got tired of complicated, difficult to learn and use libraries
for building interfaces, and wanted something easier.

<p>
I've also been successful in the software business, having founded
two different software companies, Aspen Software and Reference
Software International. I was the principle designer and author
of the widely known and used grammar checker,
Grammatik<a href="#tthFtNtAAB" name=tthFrefAAB><sup>1</sup></a>.
Basically, I see 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;as something of a public service; a way
to give something back to the software industry that has been
good to me. The concept of a portable GUI library is not
original, but I think some of the design goals of 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;are
significantly different than other similar libraries I've seen.

<p>

<UL>
<li> The main design goal is for for 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;is ease of programming.
I don't think that building the GUI part of an application should
be the hardest part of the job as it is with most native
GUI toolkits. 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;is
small, easy to learn, easy to use, and provides the essentials of
a good graphical user interface.

<p>
I have some evidence that I have succeeded in this goal. 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;has
been used for several semesters for large team projects in the
software engineering class I taught at the University of New
Mexico.  While I get many questions from my students related to
the projects they are doing, I got virtually no questions about
using 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;itself. The small number of questions about 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;has
been both startling and rewarding, and is good evidence that this
design goal has been met. 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;has also been used successfully
for a Junior level programming class. Previously, the high
overhead of learning to write applications for X has prevented
the students from writing small programs with interesting user
interfaces. The simplicity of 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;has allowed them to do this for
the first time.

<p>

<li> 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;is designed to be portable. Over the years, I've programmed
on a wide variety of interactive platforms. The main GUI
platforms widely used today include the X Window System,
Microsoft Windows (3.1, 95, and NT), OS/2, and the Macintosh. 
<em><b>V</b></em>
has been designed to work on all those platforms, and present a
look and feel that is consistent with native applications.

<p>

<li> 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;is not too big. It has less than 15 C++ classes that you
will have to interact with. This is unlike many other frameworks
that provide dozens and dozens of classes that you must learn and
understand. The 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;framework only supports GUIs. It does not
have templates, containers, and bunches of other C++ classes. If
you need a good list class, use your favorite one from another
class library. Use 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;for your interface.

<p>

<li> 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;has very good associated documentation. It is likely that
part of the reason that 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;is easy to use is that it is accompanied
by a better than average programming manual. I've tried to not only
give a useful explanation of each 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;class and function, but to
accompany each description with a short example that shows how to
use the 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;feature in a useful way. There are also several examples
provided with the 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;distribution to help you get started with a
basic 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;application.

<p>

<li> 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;is an alternative for building 
<em>compiled</em> GUI applications.
While interpretive solutions such as Tk/Tcl for building GUI
applications are becoming popular, they don't allow fully
compiled code on multiple platforms. As machines get faster and
faster, I don't think the advantage of an edit/interpret cycle
versus an edit/compile/run cycle is significant.

<p>

<li> The 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or any later version.

<p>

<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but 
<em>without any warranty</em>; without even the implied
warranty of 
<em>merchantability</em> or 
<em>fitness for a
particular purpose</em>.  See the 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html" TARGET="_main">
GNU Library General Public License</A>
for more details. (Note: that is a direct link to the
GNU web page. If you are viewing this manual off-line,
don't click there now.)

<p>

<li> The source code for 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;is of commercial quality, and I hope
some of the easiest to read and understand code you will ever
encounter (if you decide to look at the 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;source code).

<p>
</UL>There is, of course, a price to pay for the ease of programming
with 
<em><b>V</b></em>. The main constraint is that you are somewhat
restricted to following 
<em><b>V</b></em>'s (and thus my own) view of the
world. The 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;model does not exactly conform to the native
models of X, Windows, and the Mac, but it is a very good
compromise.  For the most part applications developed with 
<em><b>V</b></em>
will in fact conform to the host look and feel, but may be
lacking some of the bells and whistles of the most sophisticated
commercial applications available for a given platform. For the
vast majority of applications, this will not matter. You will end
up with applications that look pretty good, and are likely to
have a much cleaner and better interface than they would have
otherwise.

<p>
If you are a C programmer, then the fact 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;is a C++ library
might be a problem. While it is a fully object-oriented C++
framework, it can be used with C code if you know a bit about
C++. Also, 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;does not allow you to do everything you could if
you programmed in the native windowing library. You won't have
every single conceivable control, and some controls are slightly
restricted in how you can use them.

<p>
And finally, why the name 
<em><b>V</b></em>? First of all, it is a simple
name. It follows the tradition of 
<em>C</em> and 
<em>X</em>. It makes
naming the classes easier. And, my son's name is Van, which
starts with a V. So 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;it is.
