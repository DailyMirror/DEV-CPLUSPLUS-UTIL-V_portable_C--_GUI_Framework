<HR>
<a name="VIDE"></a>
<H2>The V Integrated Development Environment</H2>
<p>
<tt>VIDE</tt> is the <b>V</b> Integrated Development Environment
for the GNU g++ compiler and the standard Sun Java Development
Kit. The current release is 1.01. <tt>VIDE</tt> has been a
part of the <b>V C++ GUI Framework</B>, but is now avaiable as a
separate package. Executables for MS-Windows 9x/NT and Linux
(glibc) are available for download at
<a href="http://www.objectcentral.com/vide.htm" TARGET="_blank">
http://www.objectcentral.com/vide.htm</a>.

Note: the documentation for VIDE was formerly included with
the V GUI documentation, but it has been revised and expanded,
and is no longer included here. Please see the VIDE web page
listed above for full information. This section includes a breif
summary of VIDE features.

<p>

<tt>VIDE</tt> has been designed by a programmer for programmers.
It makes the task of developing software for C/C++, Java, and
HTML much easier than using command line mode. It is easy to
learn, so it is a good tool for the beginner. It also has the
critical features needed to enhance the productivity of the
experienced programmer.

<p>

While <tt>VIDE</tt> doesn't have every feature found in many
commercial development systems, it is an ongoing project, with
more features included in each release. And best of   
all, <tt>VIDE</tt> is <i>free</i>! The source code is available
under the GNU Public License (GPL), so you can help add even more
features if you want.

<p>

The main features in the current release of <tt>VIDE</tt>
include:
<UL>
<LI>An important part of an IDE is a good editor.
The <tt>VIDE</tt> editor is a very good editor designed for the
programmer. Editor features include:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Syntax Highlighting for C/C++, Java, and HTML.
<LI>Several editor command sets, including:
<UL>
<LI> A <b>generic</b> modeless command set, similar to many Windows
editors.
<LI><b><i>Vi</i></b> - the standard Unix editor, with extensions.
<LI>The <b>See</b> editor command set, an editor designed and used by
Bruce Wampler, the author of <b>V</b> and <tt>VIDE</tt>.
<LI>Others easily added by extending a C++ class.
</UL>
<LI>Formats C/C++ and Java code
<LI>Powerful command macro capability
</UL>
<p>
<LI>Project Files - specify source files, compiler options,
and other details required for g++ or Java. Project files
simplify and hide most of the details of using  the underlying
tools.
<p>
<LI>Supports development of both C/C++ with the <b>GNU gcc/g++</b> compiler
for MS-Windows and Linux, (OS/2 environment soon), as well as the
Java development using the <b>Sun JDK</b>.
<p>
<LI>Uses standard GNU <tt>make</tt> to build projects for
g++, and the standard features of the JDK to build Java projects.
<p>
<LI>Point and click to go to errors in source files.
<p>
<LI>Integrated support for GNU <b>gdb</b> debugger for C/C++.
Common tasks, such as stepping through a program, are fully
integrated, yet all the features of <b>gdb</b> are available
through a command line window.
<p>
<LI>Integrated support for Sun <b>jdb</b> for Java.
<p>
<LI>Integrated support for the <b>V</b> GUI for C++, including
the <b>V</b> app generator and the <b>V</b> icon editor.
<p>
<LI>Extra support for HTML development. While <tt>VIDE</tt> doesn't
support WYSIWYG HTML development, you can send the current HTML
file to your browser for immediate viewing. Future versions will
include more HTML features such as table generation and image
sizing.
<p>
<LI>Includes extensive HTML based help. Covers <tt>VIDE</tt>, GNU
utilities, C/C++ libraries, HTML, and more. The help files are
available for separate download. You can see a complete online
version of the help package
<a href="http://www.objectcentral.com/vide/help/vhelp.htm" TARGET="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.
</UL>
<p>
The executable version of <tt>VIDE</tt> is totally freeware. Use
it, share it, do whatever you want. The source of <tt>VIDE</tt>
falls under the GNU General Public License, and is normally
included with the <b>V</b> GUI distribution. See the file COPYING
included with the distribution for more information.  Its
development is not always in phase with the current <b>V</b>
distribution, so there will be additional releases of executable
versions as they become available. With the added support for
Java, it is likely that the standalone executable version will
see broader use than the source version included with V.
