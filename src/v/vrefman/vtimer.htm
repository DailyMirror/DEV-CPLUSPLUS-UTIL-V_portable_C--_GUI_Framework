<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This is a utility class that allows you to get events driven
by the system timer. The accuracy and resolution of timers on
various systems varies, so this should be used only to get
events on a more or less regular basis. Use the C library <tt>time</tt>
routines to get real clock time.
<p>
The V Appgen utility offers an option for adding a timer to the status bar. Looking
at that generated code is a good way to understand <tt>vTimer</tt> objects.

<p>

<h2>New Methods</h2>

<p>

<H4>vTimer</H4>
This constructs a timer object. The timer doesn't run until
you start it with <tt>TimerSet</tt>. To make a timer useful, you
can override the constructor to add a pointer to a window, and
then use that pointer from within your <tt>TimerTick</tt> method
to do something in that window: <tt>myTimer(vWindow* useWindow)</tt>.

<p>

<H4>int TimerSet(long interval)</H4>
This starts the timer going. The timer will call your overridden
<tt>TimerTick</tt> method approximately every <tt>interval</tt>
milliseconds until you stop the timer. Most systems don't support
an unlimited number of timers, and <tt>TimerSet</tt> will return 0
if it couldn't get a system timer.

<p>

<H4>void TimerStop()</H4>
Calling this stops the timer, but does not destruct it.

<p>

<H4>void TimerTick()</H4>
This method is called by the system every interval milliseconds
(more or less). The way to use the timer is to derive your own
class, and override the <tt>TimerTick</tt> method.  Your method
will be called according to the interval set for the timer. Note
that you can't count on the accuracy of the timer interval.
