Used to define commands on a command bar.

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
A command pane is a horizontal bar in a command window that
holds <tt>CommandObjects</tt>.  You can use any of the
<tt>CommandObjects</tt>, although they all might not make sense
to use on a command bar (a List, for example, is a bit large for
the visual paradigm, but it would work). The layout
is left to right, so you don't need to fill in the RightOf
and Below fields. You can include Frames in a command bar,
and commands contained in that frame do use the RightOf
and Below attributes. 

<p>
You define the commands on a command bar using a
<tt>CommandObject</tt> array. You first create the command pane
with <tt>myCmdPane = new vCommandPane(CommandBar)</tt>, and
then add it to the window with <tt>AddPane(myCmdPane)</tt>.

<p>
You then handle the command objects in a command bar pretty much
like the same way as in a dialog. The main difference is that you
use the <tt>vWindow</tt> versions of <tt>SetValue</tt> and <tt>WindowCommand</tt>
instead of the corresponding methods of the <tt>vDialog</tt> class.
Other than the left to right ordering, things are pretty much the
same.

<p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
The discussion of <tt>CommandObject</tt> and <tt>vDialog</tt> contains
several examples of defining command objects.

<p>
See the section <tt><A HREF="vpane.htm">vPane</A></tt> for a general description of panes.
