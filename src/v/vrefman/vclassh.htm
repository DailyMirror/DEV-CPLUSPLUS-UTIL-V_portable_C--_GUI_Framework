<H1>V Class Hierarchy</H1>
<HR>

<p>
The following figure is shows the internal organization of the 
<em><b>V</b></em>\
class hierarchy. Note that boxes with a double line edge denote
classes that
have object instances, while boxes with single line edges are abstract
classes used to build subclasses.  Most of the time, you won't care
about these abstract classes.

<p>
Also note that the classes derived from <tt>vCmd</tt> represent the
classes used to implement command objects. Normally, you won't need
to used these classes directly. Instances of these objects are generated
by 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;from your <tt>CommandObject</tt> declarations when you call
<tt>AddDialogCmds</tt>.
