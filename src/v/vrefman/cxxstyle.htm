<H1>The V C++ Coding Style Guidelines</H1>
I have developed the following guidelines for writing C++ code
over my long career as a programmer. All of 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;has been written
using these guidelines, and I believe that using them is a big
first step leading to readable, portable, and reliable code.
Of course, just following these guidelines won't automatically
give you that, but I think they are still necessary.

<p>

<H2>Readability</H2>
The ultimate goal of style guidelines is to help you to write code
that is readable. While this means code that is readable by you,
it mostly means code that is readable by others. Remember,

<em>code has a life of its own!</em> No matter how small the project
may seem, or how temporary, most code ends up being used and reused
much longer than you might think. The real cost of software
is often in the long term maintenance. While you may end up maintaining
your own code, often it will be someone else. Even if it is you,
after a few months, or even weeks, you will have likely forgotten
just exactly what you were doing when you wrote the code to begin
with.

<p>
The point of this is to emphasize the importance of producing readable
code. Generally, readable code is inviting to look at. It is visually
pleasing, just as a well designed book is well laid out and visually
pleasing to look at.  Your code should have plenty of visual attributes
that make it easy to read.  This means lots of whitespace, consistent
indentation, abundant, well formatted comments, and visual
separation of important sections of code. Much of the structure
of your code should be visually obvious without having to read it.
Many of the following guidelines are intended to help
you produce readable code.

<p>

<H2>Naming</H2>
It is critical to choose meaningful names for your variables and
functions. Avoid short, two or three letter names unless those
names are really meaningful. While you may want to use short,
abbreviated names to avoid typing, this habit will make your
code more difficult to read later. While you should avoid
short names, consistently using names that are too long can
present problems, too. This can lead to code that must be
split across multiple lines because the names are too long.
Even so, it is probably better to trend to overly long names
than short, abbreviated names.

<p>
Names should use both upper and lower case letters, using
a case change to indicate word breaks. For example, a name
like <tt>maxLength</tt> is more readable than <tt>MAXLENGTH</tt>,
<tt>maxlength</tt>, or even <tt>max_length</tt>. In general,
using mixed case is better than using underscores. Underscores are
better used to indicate special classes of variables (see Class
Definitions below).

<p>

<H2>Files</H2>
Each C++ module should be split into two files - the <tt>.h</tt> header
file which contains <tt>class</tt> definitions and variable declarations,
and a <tt>.c</tt> or <tt>.cpp</tt><a href="#tthFtNtAAB" name=tthFrefAAB><sup>1</sup></a> file that contains
source code for the functions.

<p>
Generally, each class will have its own <tt>.h</tt> and <tt>.cpp</tt>
files. Utility helper functions that go with a class can be included
in the same file as the class. Other functions that do not go with
a class should be collected into logical groups and kept in 
a separate file. In general, files should not be much larger than
twenty to forty thousand characters long.

<p>

<H2>Include Files</H2>

<p>
Include files or header files (<tt>.h</tt>) files must each have
a <tt>#define</tt> statement that prevents problems caused by
multiple inclusion. The standard way to do this is:

<p>

<font size=-2>
<pre>
//
//  myclass.h - header file for myclass class definition
//
#ifndef MYCLASS_H              // Check to prevent
#define MYCLASS_H              // multiple inclusion

    ... definitions go here

#endif                         // last line of file
</pre></font>
Files are included from the source file by placing the #include
statement near the beginning of the source file, starting in
column one.

<p>
<font size=-2>
<pre>

#include "myclass.h"      // includes start in column 1

</pre></font>

<H2>Function Definitions</H2>
All functions should have a prototype definition for use
by others. For class methods, this will be part of the class
declaration. For other functions, this should also be in a
<tt>.h</tt> file. The parameters of all prototypes should include
both the 
<em>type</em> and the 
<em>name</em> of each parameter since
the name often conveys extra useful information.

<p>
The body of each method or function should use this convention:

<p>
<font size=-2>
<pre>
//==================&#62;&#62;&#62; myClass::myMethod &lt;&lt;&lt;===================
  void myClass::myMethod(const int size)
  {
    // An introductory block of comments explaining the purpose
    // and interface to this function. You can also include an
    // author and modification history here if appropriate.

    ... declare variables used throughout the function

    ... body of function
  }
</pre></font>
Each function should include the separator line to visually
separate the body of the function from others in the same file.
The preferred indentation for the function name is two spaces,
with the enclosing { and } braces on separate lines, also
indented two spaces. An acceptable alternative style is to
have these lines start in the first column.

<p>
Following the opening { should come an introduction to the
function. Variables required by the entire function follow
the opening comments.  Following that is the body of the function.
Make liberal use of whitespace for visual separation.

<p>

<H2>Indentation</H2>
The preferred indentation scheme is based on groups of four
spaces, with braces indented two additional spaces. It is
acceptable to keep braces lined up with the outer statement
rather than indenting two extra, but all braces 
<em>must</em>
be on a line by themselves. This spacing works well with
standard eight character tab stops - your code will either
be indented on even tab stops, or on tab stops plus four.

<p>
Except for the most trivial cases of short, related assignment
statements, each statement should be on a separate line.
The body of loops and conditional statements should always
use braces - never use a simple statement. There are two reasons
for this. First, using braces on separate lines adds whitespace,
which adds to the readability. Second, code is inevitably modified,
and by always using braces, you will be more likely to add
a statement in the proper place. As a special case for
initializer loops with no code body, it is acceptable to use just
a semicolon rather than braces.

<p>
The old K&amp;R style of placing the opening brace at the end
of the line is not acceptable. Most importantly, you lose
the visual impact of lined up braces when you do this. It
also tends to compress the code, and extra whitespace really
helps make code more readable.

<p>
When calling functions that require long, complex argument
lists, it is often advisable to place each argument on a
separate line accompanied by an explanatory comment.

<p>
Use a blank between keywords and the associated left paren:
<tt>if (test)</tt>.  Don't put a space for function calls:
<tt>function(param);</tt>. Don't use parens for the returned
value of a <tt>return</tt> statement. This helps to visually
distinguish a <tt>return</tt> from a function call.

<p>
The following code demonstrates indentation for various
C++ statements:

<p>
<font size=-2>
<pre>
//=====================&#62;&#62;&#62; sample &lt;&lt;&lt;=====================
  int sample(int action)
  {
    // This meaningless sample demonstrates indentation.
    // The code should not considered to do anything useful
    // other than demonstrating indentation.

    char* name;                 // explain each variable
    int set;                    // with useful comment

    if (action)                 // indent 4, space after if
      {                         // the { in 2
        set = doSomething(action);
      }                         // always use {}'s
    else
      {
        set = SomethingElse(action);
      }

    switch (set)                // example for switch
      {
        case 1:                 // case in +4 from switch
          {                     // always use braces for cases!
            getName1(name); 
            break;
          }

        case 2:                 // Try to comment each case
          {
            int temp = len(name);  // try to declare as needed
            fixName(temp,name);
            break;
          }

        default:                // Good idea to have default
            break;
      }

    // Prefix some blocks with comments like this
    // to describe what a section of code does
    // Note that 'char* cp' is preferred to 'char *cp'.
    // Take advantage of C++ scope rules, and declare
    // variables (e.g., len) as close to use as possible.
    for (int len = 0, char* cp = name ; *cp ; ++cp)
      {
        ++len;                 // all loops use {}'s
        tryThat(set,cp);       // and meaningful comments!
      }

    while (IsStillOK(name))    // indent like for
      {
        Complex(name,          // a complex function call
            set,               // can explain each parameter
            len);              // for easier maintenance
      }

    int status = (checkName(name)) ? len    // sample ?:
                                   : len / 2;

    return status;             // no parens on return
  }
</pre></font>
<H2>Comments</H2>
It is difficult to over comment your code. Comments are
one of the most helpful things you can do to make your code
easier to maintain. A 1 to 1 ratio of comments to code should
be considered a bare minimum, with a ratio of more comments than
code probably a better thing.

<p>
I claim it is almost impossible to have too many comments. A few
expert programmers may disagree with this philosophy, and say that
well written code can be self-commenting. The problem is that
this is not really true. Assume, for example, that you are using
a standard software library, such as <tt>Xt</tt> or 
<em><b>V</b></em>. You may know the
library backwards and forwards, and it may seem perfectly clear
to you what some code is doing. But assume that someone else
will be maintaining the code later. They may not know the library
as well, and what is obvious and self-commenting to you will
be gibberish to them. A few well placed comments explaining what
you are doing will be very helpful.

<p>
In order to write really effective comments, you must
comment 
<em>as you write the code</em>! Do not go back and
add comments after the code is written. You can go back and
improve and expand your comments, but you should comment as
you go. A few seconds taken to add a comment as you write the
code can save many minutes or even hours later.

<p>
Comments should be meaningful and correct. If you change code,
be sure you change the comments to correspond! If you are in the
habit of commenting as you write, this will not be so hard.

<p>
Make the layout of your comments visually pleasing. Use whitespace
to separate sections of code. Line up block comments near the
left, and try to keep short per line comments lined up on
the right without going too far right. Line them up on a tab
stop if possible.

<p>
Above all, remember that what seems obvious to you at the moment
is likely to be forgotten even a week or two later.  And keep in
mind that someone else is likely to modify or study your code
later.  Don't keep secrets. If you had to look something up, or
have other information that might make the code more
understandable, put that in a comment.  If you are doing
something tricky or obscure (which you should avoid, but
sometimes can't avoid), explain what is going on! You might be
teaching a valuable trick to whoever is working with your code
later!

<p>
My own code has more comments than almost any other code I've seen.
Time after time, when someone else has had to use or maintain my
code, I've gotten feedback that it is very easy to understand and
modify. I attribute much of this positive feedback to the abundant
comments found in my code.

<p>

<H2>Class Definitions</H2>

<p>
The standards for class definitions are based on keeping
braces on separate lines, and on not using implicit assumptions.
Thus, a class will have braces on separate lines, either indented
two (the preferred style), or lined up with the class statement.

<p>
There should always be all three <tt>public</tt>, <tt>protected</tt>,
and <tt>private</tt> sections in that order, even if a section is
empty. This order assumes it is more useful to have the public
stuff at the top for easier readability. And even if a section
is empty, that conveys information about the definition of the class.
The prototypes for member functions should include both the type
and name (e.g., <tt>int OnOrOff</tt>).

<p>
There should almost never be public access to class variables.
Provide methods to access and set variables of the class. You
may find it helpful to prefix class variables (especially private
class variables) with an underscore (_variableName) to indicate
the variable is private to the class.

<p>
The following example shows indentation and layout of a class
definition. Note the visual separator for public, protected, and
private, and the alignment with the braces.

<p>
<font size=-2>
<pre>
    class myClass : public superClass    // name here
      {
        friend int FriendFunction(int ival);  // friends at top

      public:    //-------------------------- public

        myClass();          // constructor and destructor
        virtual ~myClass(); // first

        // simple methods can be inline
        int getVal() { return _val; }
        virtual void service(int iParam);    // prototype

      protected:  //------------------------- protected

        // even an empty section conveys information

      private:    //------------------------- private

        int _val;           // _ for class variables
      };
</pre></font>
<H2>C++ Language Features</H2>

<p>
With C++, it is preferred to use <tt>const</tt> definitions
of symbolic values rather than <tt>#defines</tt>.

<p>
Use <tt>const</tt> parameters whenever possible.

<p>
Declare variables as you need them, preferably inside
a code block, rather than all at the top of a function.
This makes your code much more maintainable, and helps
avoid errors introduced by bad reuse of a variable,
especially in loops.

<p>
For each <tt>new</tt> operation, there 
<em>must</em> be a
corresponding <tt>delete</tt> operation. These <tt>new</tt>
and <tt>delete</tt> pairs will often be found in the
constructor and destructor for your objects.

<p>

<em>Always</em> define copy constructors and an assignment operator
for each class if they use pointers and dynamic memory allocation
using <tt>new</tt>. Some of the biggest problems in C++ code
involves objects with pointers to dynamically allocated
space. You should use either deep copy semantics or reference
counts to avoid creating objects with dangling pointers.

<p>
When using 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;use the debug macros as much as possible.
It is especially helpful to use <tt>UserDebug</tt> statements
in constructors and destructors.

<p>

<H2>Software Portability</H2>
Always remember that your code might someday be ported to a
different system. Keep this in mind when writing your code.
These guidelines will help to make your code more portable.

<p>
Don't use nonstandard or nonportable language features. For
example, templates are not yet universally portable. Avoid
using them.

<p>
Use restrictive names when naming files. The most conservative
approach is to use single case names limited to 8 characters
for the name part, and 3 for the extension. This should
get better as time goes by, but for now this is still
a pretty good idea.

<p>
If you must use system calls, abstract them and isolate them
in a single place.

<p>
Don't go behind the back of 
<em><b>V</b></em>&nbsp;to access X directly.

<p>
Avoid conversions that are Big and Little Endian dependent.
If you need them, isolate them.
