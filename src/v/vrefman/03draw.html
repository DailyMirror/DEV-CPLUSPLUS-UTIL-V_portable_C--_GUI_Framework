<h2>Fast way to display bitmaps?</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
I'm using V to display bitmaps. My app is rendering a complex
image so I would like to display the result every few seconds. I
tried drawing my bitmap with DrawIcon, but it takes too long and
the second call to the function displays the same bitmap even if
the data of the vIcon changed. I tried using a pen and drawing
points one by one but that is way too slow.
<p>

<dd>
So, is there any easy and fast way to display 24-bit bitmaps
using V?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
This may be one of the weaker parts of V. I've spent a good deal
of time with this issue, and can't get stuff real fast. In
theory, writing to a vMemDC should be the fastest way to write
pixels, which you can do a row at a time with DrawColorPoints,
then transferring to the screen with CopyFromMemDC.
This technique get you about as close to the native drawing stuff
as can be done portably, but it is still faster to draw
directly to the screen using DrawColorPoints. It isn't
real fast.
<p>

<dd>
The native tool kits let you work directly with the bitmap/pixmap
in memory, but do it quite differently on Windows and X. Perhaps
someday I'll figure out a way to give portable access to the
underlying model.
<p>

<dd>
An alternative, and not a terrible one, is to get the handle
to the actual X or Windows window used for the canvas.
This is HWND vCanvas::DrawingWindow() for Windows, and
Widget vCanvas::DrawingWindow() -OR- 
Drawable vCanvas::GetXDrawable() for X. You can then use
the HWND or Widget/Drawable as to draw to directly using
the native drawing toolkits. These are usually much easier
to use and figure out than all the control stuff for dialogs
and menus.

<h2>More on displaying images fast</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
I'm thinking of using V for a project I'm about to start.  I need to 
be able to display images (8, 16, 24, and maybe 32 bit) to a window 
and I need to do it very fast.
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
Actually, in its current state, V can't really do what you need.
The vMemoryDC already uses BitBlt to in the CopyFromMemoryDC
method, but it is still too slow - it takes too long to fill
the image, no matter what mode you use.
<p>

<dd>
The ultimate solution is to provide access directly to the
screen memory via a pointer. This is something like Microsoft's
game API. However, I haven't had the time to do it portably,
although I think it can be done.
<p>

<dd>
The alternative is to drop down to real Windows or X code.
The vCanvas provides the necessary hooks to get the Window,
Drawable, or Widget as needed. This solution is not portable.

<h2>Coordinate Translation and Scaling</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
When using a canvas with scaling and translation, it's not clear
whether coordinates are first translated and then scaled, or vice
versa.
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<pre>
  ScreenX = (((PassedInX + XTranslate) * ScaleMult) / ScaleDiv);

<h2>About colors and color maps</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
I assume that V tries to allocate read/write color cells when under X,
so that it can (possibly) change colors.  If the color map is full,
does it just take what it can get?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
Presently, V tries to hide what is going on with the color map.
This led to some problems on the X version in earlier releases.
With V Version 1.07 and later, V tries to allow efficient
use of the colormap while still hiding most of the details.
<p>

<dd>
The main way to use and generate colors is with vColor objects.
There are 16 predefined vColors, and you can declare other
vColors, either with no color specified (which defaults to black),
or your own colors. Ideally, it wouldn't matter how many colors
you used, or how many vColors you declared, or how many times
you changed the color value of vColor objects.
<p>

<dd>
In  reality, some color systems do allow unlimited colors, but
most existing systems run with a palette or color map of 256
colors. So mostly, at any given time, a program can have only
256 active colors. As better color hardware gets more widely
used, this situation will change, but count on only 256 for now.
<p>

<dd>
The question then becomes which 256 colors are available to
the program. Both X and Windows provide default system
color maps that provide the current 256 colors, and V uses
the default system color maps. The way the system color maps
work are somewhat different for X and Windows, however.
<p>

<dd>
The situation for X is currently somewhat better than Windows.
The default system color map is allocated partly ReadOnly, and
partly ReadWrite. Usually, four to eight colors are allocated
ReadOnly, and correspond to black, white, and the basic colors
used by the screen manager. The rest of the entries are available
for program use. When you create a new color, either by declaring
a vColor object with a new color, or you use vColor::Set to set
an existing object to a new color, a new cell of the system
color map is allocated and used. If you continue to generate
more new colors, the map eventually fills up, and you don't
get what you had hoped for.
<p>

<dd>
With V Version 1.07 and later, a new method called 
vColor::ResetColor was added to help solve this problem.
If you will be generating lots of new colors, you can
only use about 245 or so of them at a time. If you
use vColor::Set to change the colors, the color map
fills up. If, on the other hand, you reuse and existing
vColor object by calling vColor::ResetColor, then the
original entry in the X system color map is reused.
Thus, as long as you don't use more than the number of
available entries in the color map, you won't have
problems displaying just what you want at any given time.
You can use vColor::BitsOfColor to determine the color
resolution of the system you are running on.
<p>

<dd>
The situation on Windows is different. There, you still
usually have 256 colors, but the default system color
map (called a palette in Windows jargon) is fixed.
Each time you use a color, Windows uses the closest
match, and this is sometimes a dithered color. Thus,
while you will never run out of palette entries, you
also don't always get the color you wanted. 
<p>

<dd>
Since Windows systems more commonly have more colors, and
since you don't run out of color map entries, I don't
plan to change this soon. Changing would mean adding
a color map or pallete V object, with all the portability
problems that introduces. For now, vColor::Set and
vColor::Reset have identical behavior on Windows, but
quite different behavior on X.

<h2>When to set attributes for a vCanvasPane</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
When *exactly* is the right time to set such attributes as
Background color etc. to a vCanvasPane? The attached DC is not
available at constructor call, so I tricked around using static
variables and Redraw(), but there has to be a cleaner way, no?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
Actually, you got it. Redraw is called when the window
is first displayed, before you have any chance to call
any of your code. So, you really do need something like:
<p>

<pre>
  void myCanvas::Redraw(int x, int y, int h, int w)
  {
    static int first = 1;

    // Redraw is called when the canvas is first displayed,
    // before your code can do any real work. The vDC is
    // available at this point. Any special initialization
    // needs to be done here because the vDC is not
    // available at constructor time.
    if (first)
      {
        first = 0;

        // Set colors, whatever now...

        // And call your parent class's Redraw
        vParentPane::Redraw(x,y,h,w);
        return;
      }
    // Normal Redraw code goes here
    ....
  }
</pre>

<h2>Too many Redraw messages to keep up with</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
My V application takes quite a bit of time to redraw its
image. When I drag another window across the V app's window,
the app gets behind trying to keep up with all the Redraw
messages sent by this action. Is there a way around this
problem?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
This problem doesn't occur on all platforms. (e.g., Windows
draws an outline of the top window, avoiding these multiple
calls to Redraw. X and NT do generate multiple calls.)
No matter how fast V drawing ever gets, this situation will
no doubt continue to exist. There is a rather simple solution
that works for the V Icon editor that limits the total number
of redraws to 2.  Consider the following code fragment adapted
from the V Icon Editor code:
<p>

<pre>
//===================>>> myCanvasPane::Redraw <<<=================
  void myCanvasPane::Redraw(int x, int y, int w, int h)
  {
    // Cheap way to handle multiple calls to Redraw that
    // doesn't use the passed coordinates.

    static int nest = 0;  // Track multiple calls to Redraw

    if (++nest > 1)   // ignore multiple calls
        return;

    DrawImage();      // draw image - may take a while

    if (nest > 1)     // had nested calls, so need to redraw again
      {
        DrawImage();  // draw image
      }
   nest = 0;          // Really done
  }
</pre>
