<h2>WINDOWS.H and WINDOWSX.H files for Windows version</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
I downloaded the V C++ GUI package for Microsoft Windows from
your website and attempted  to compile and run the tutorial
(TUTAPP.CPP), only to discover that it indirectly  required two
files named "WINDOWS.H" and "WINDOWSX.H". I don't have either
of these  files. Where can I get them?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
WINDOWS.H and WINDOWSX.H are the files that define the interface
to the Windows API toolkit. All Windows apps require these files.
They are usually provided with your compiler.

<h2>Cygnus gcc-win32</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
Does V work with the Cygwin environment?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
The standard V distribution includes support for the latest
Cygwin compiler (B20 at this writing). There is also occasional
discussions of V on the Cygwin mail group.

<h2>Missing files/libraries in X</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
I'm trying to compile your V libraries on Linux and seem to be missing 
some of the include files for X.  The only subdirectories I have beyond 
include/X11 are Bitmaps and Pixmaps which aren't really include 
directories.  For example, I'm missing the "Xaw" and "Xmu" directories 
to name a few.  Could you direct me to where I could get the extra 
include files that I require to build the libraries?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
V assumes that X has been installed on your system in some place,
usually something like /usr/X11 or /usr/X11R6 and other related
spots. The standard X installation contains the X include files,
X libraries, and others. V also needs the Athena widget set, Xaw,
and other files. Some systems don't install these (especially
Motif only systems), although most do. Almost always, if your
system is running X, then the required files are probably there.
<p>

<dd>
Other that this general information, it is beyond my capability
to provide more help about proper installation of X on your
system. Check with your system administrator for help on that.

<h2>OS/2 Version</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
Why is the OS/2 Version different or out of sync with the
other V versions?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
The OS/2 version was written and is maintained by Jon Hacker.
We do our best to keep versions in sync, but it is not always
possible.

<h2>Mac Version</h2>
</a>

<font size=+2>Q:</font>

<dd>
When will a Mac version be available?
<p>
<font size=+2>A:</font>

<dd>
I don't know. Probably never, unless someone volunteers
to do the port. For some time, the Mac looked pretty dead,
but perhaps the new iMac will be Apple's salvation. But
to date, there has not been enough interest expressed for
a Mac port. Volunteers?
