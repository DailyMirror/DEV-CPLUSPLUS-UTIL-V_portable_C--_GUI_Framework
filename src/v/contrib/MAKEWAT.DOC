Installing 'V' for WatcomC v10.5

Well, the previous WatcomC MAKEFILEs were a mess and this was what I cooked up
myself.

1. edit the pathnames for WatcomC and 'V' classlib in the makefiles
2. cd \v\watcom\win32 (or appropriate dir)
3. wmake -f vlib32.mk1

Should leave a ``vlib32.lib'' in \v\watcom\win32 (or appropriate dir)

4. wmake -f iconed.mk1

creates sample program ``iconed.exe'' - and the other makefiles create
executables with same names.
